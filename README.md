## About Django

Python-based Django is a free and open-source web application framework. Clean, practical design and quick web development are both possible with it. It was created by seasoned programmers to simplify repetitious chores so that we could concentrate on creating apps rather than inventing the wheel. Read more about django through [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/)

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/). If you're just getting started, here's how we recommend you read the docs:

First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.
Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt, docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).
If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.
You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics) next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.
See docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.
